# rtportfolio-project

this is a project that I worked on to learn the basics of the Django framework. It uses a Ubuntu droplet, PostgreSQL database, 
and django 2 for the backend, with Bootstrap 4 as the CSS and javascript frontend. I handwrote all of the code myself while 
following a tutorial, though I challenged myself to figure things out for the logic portions and practiced things that were 
repeating without the guidance of the tutorial. I feel that I could create another Django site with my knowledge and notes at this 
point.
